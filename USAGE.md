# FlockStats - How to view this

Welcome. This page explains the dashboard in simple terms.

## What this is
FlockStats shows how many people contributed to Thunderbird in recent time windows. It updates once a day.

## How to view it
1. Open the dashboard link in your browser.
2. You will see four numbers:
   - Contributors in the last 30 days
   - Contributors in the last 90 days
   - Contributors in the last 365 days
   - All-time contributors
3. The page also shows the time of the last update.

You do not need to log in or install anything.

## How it updates
The numbers refresh once per day by an automated job. If you visit during an update, the page may show an error message. If that happens, refresh the page in a few minutes.

## What counts as a contributor today
For this first version we count unique people who made commits to Thunderbird repositories on GitHub. More sources will be added soon.

## Privacy
The dashboard shows totals only. It does not reveal private data. The system never publishes raw email addresses.

## Need help
If the page shows an error after a refresh, contact the team and share a screenshot.
